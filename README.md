# Regression
# The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables.
# In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events.

#Linear Regression?
In Machine Learning lingo, Linear Regression (LR) means simply finding the best fitting line that explains the variability between the dependent and independent features very well or we can say it describes the linear relationship between independent and dependent features, and in linear regression, the algorithm predicts the continuous features(e.g. Salary, Price ), rather than deal with the categorical features (e.g. cat, dog).
